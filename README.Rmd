# ATQ: Assesing Evaluation Metrics for Timely Epidemic Detection Models

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ATQ is to provide accurate alert metrics for epidemics using school absenteeism data. This package will allow users to simulate school absenteeism, epidemics, and spread of people within a region using population proportions from census data. Using these simulated data, an optimal alert metric can be determined.

## Installation:

You can install the development version of ATQ from [Github](https://github.com/vjoshy/ATQ_Surveillance_Package)

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("https://github.com/vjoshy/ATQ_Surveillance_Package.git")
```

## Usage

ATQ contains eight funcions which are to be used in sequentially in the following order:\

1. catchment_sim()
2. elementary_pop()
3. subpop_children()
4. subpop_noChildren()
5. simulate_households()
6. simepi()
7. model_data()
8. eval_metrics()

```{r example}
library(ATQ)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
