Description: This package provides tools for evaluating timely epidemic detection models within a school absenteeism-based surveillance system. It introduces the concept of alert time quality as an evaluation metric. Users can simulate populations, epidemics, and alert metrics associated with epidemic spread using population census data. The methods implemented in this package are based on research published in the following papers: <doi:10.1186/s12889-023-15747-z> and <doi:10.1186/s12889-019-7521-7>.    References: <doi:10.1186/s12889-023-15747-z> , <doi:10.1186/s12889-019-7521-7>
